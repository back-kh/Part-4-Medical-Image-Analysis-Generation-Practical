# KhmerFormer: Multi-Scale CNNs-Transformer with External Attention for Ancient Khmer Palm Leaf Isolated Glyph Classification
##Abstract:
Ancient Khmer palm leaf manuscripts are invaluable cultural artifacts in Southeast Asia, especially in Cambodia. The preservation and study of these manuscripts are hindered by their complex glyph structures and the scarcity of resources for ancient languages. This paper introduces KhmerFormer, a hybrid model that combines Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MS-CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with External Attention (EA) mechanisms to enhance glyph classification tasks. Our approach includes a preprocessing algorithm for Khmer glyph enhancements (IEPalmV2) and leverages multi-scale feature extraction with EfficientNet, followed by integration into ViTs where traditional self-attention is replaced by external attention. This model is tailored to address the unique and intricate challenges presented by ancient Khmer manuscripts. Our study is evaluated in ICFHR 2018 and newly extracted datasets show significant performance enhancements, particularly in handling low-resource and imbalanced datasets. Our results highlight the potential of hybrid architectures in advancing the analysis of historical documents and providing robust solutions for their preservation.
